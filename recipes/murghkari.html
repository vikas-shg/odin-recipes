                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
                                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches <br>
                                    until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
                                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. <br>
                                    Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and<br>
                                    bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
                                <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. <br>
                                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
