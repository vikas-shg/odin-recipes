                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
                                <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
                                <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
                                <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                                <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about <br>
                                    the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a<br>
                                    towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
                                <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
                                <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can <br>
                                    fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook <br>
                                    until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
