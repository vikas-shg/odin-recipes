Just creating my first odin project website

Version 1

I started the odin project on 27 Dec 2022 and now it's my second day into the project. I am going to create my first sort of website, a recipe site and push it on github.

So far I have completed about 40% of the fundamentals course and learned basics about html only.

Let's go!
